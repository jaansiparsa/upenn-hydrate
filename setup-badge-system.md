### **Step 2: Test the System**
1. **Refresh your app** (http://localhost:5175)
2. **Go to your profile** - you should see a new "Badges & Achievements" section
3. **Create a review** - this should trigger badge checking
4. **Follow a user** - this should check for social badges

### **Step 3: Verify Badge Functionality**

## 📊 Badge Analytics

The system tracks:

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**If badges don't appear:**
1. Check that the migration was applied successfully
2. Verify RLS policies are working
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Ensure user is logged in

**If badge checking fails:**
1. Check the `checkAndAwardBadges` function calls
2. Verify database permissions
3. Check for TypeScript errors

The badge system is now fully integrated and ready to gamify your hydration app! 🎉
